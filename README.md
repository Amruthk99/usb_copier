# USB Copier
Hi guys...
This is my first mini tool written in Python(atleast it actually useful and works :P).
This is a simple script to copy all files from a USB drive without the knowledge of user.
I am thinking to automate the script whenever a USB is plugged.
Right now, I need to click on the python script..
I will update the the automated script soon....
I actually dont know how to automate,so, help from you is highly appreciated.(I am thinking to use a Daemon module to automate :).. ).
Please feel free to contribute..
